My very first own html/css project created for local pillow company. After finishing html/css course I wanted to practice and summarise all knowledge in some little project ðŸŽ“ 

I always assume that the best way to learn coding is to come up with your own initiative and new projects ðŸ’¹ This way of learning, firstly, will create new problems that I will have to learn to solve, and secondly, it will allow me to master the knowledge faster ðŸ’¨
